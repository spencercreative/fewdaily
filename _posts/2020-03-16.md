This Monday Medley covers The CSS Podcast, WordPress 5.4, and Variable Fonts.

## The CSS Podcast

Una Kravets and Adam Argyle, two developer advocates at Google, have started a podcast to discuss everything CSS. Aptly named [The CSS Podcast](https://pod.link/thecsspodcast), they’re covering all aspects of the web’s core styling language. So far there has been one episode released on March 12 that discusses the Box Model. The CSS Podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and more.

## WordPress 5.4

WordPress 5.4 will be packed with updates and new features. Most notably are the updates to the block editor, including a new social icons block, a new buttons block that allows more than one inline button, and several updates to existing core block editor features. WordPress 5.4 is scheduled for release on March 31st. For more information, check out the [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-5-4/) and [WPBeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/news/whats-coming-in-wordpress-5-4-features-and-screenshots/) blogs for more information, or see the [WordPress 5.4 development cycle](https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-4/).

## Variable Fonts Performance Effects

Variable fonts are a hot topic in the web design community because they include all the variations of a typeface in a single file, rather than individual files for each variation. However, it is important to recognize the performance effects of a single large file and how to mitigate them. For example, if you’re loading 12 variations of a static font, it is typically quicker to load the variable font.
