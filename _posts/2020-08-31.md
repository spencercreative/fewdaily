## Open-Source for Beginners

One of the greatest parts of being a developer is using and participating in open-source projects. But it can seem intimidating for first-time developers to jump into a project. A post yesterday on the DEV community goes through [how to contribute to an open-source project for beginners](https://dev.to/tracycss/open-source-contribution-for-beginners-1mhe). It outlines some basic skills you might need to get started and some initial ideas for how to contribute.

## Bootstrap Icons

On Friday, Bootstrap released the first stable version of its custom icons. With over 1,100 icons in the initial release, you are bound to find the icon you are looking for. The icons are SVG-based, which makes them very versatile in their utility. Read more about Bootstrap icons from the [release notes](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/08/28/bootstrap-icons-stable/) and the [documentation](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

For those who love to use WordPress and build React websites, it is the perfect combination.
