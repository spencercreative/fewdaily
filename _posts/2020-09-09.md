## Reduced Motion Design

Modern web browsers now support a wide range of CSS and JavaScript properties that can create awesome interactive features and animations. However, it is important to keep accessibility in mind and realize that some people have sensitivities to too much motion. Yesterday's post on Smashing Magazine outlined [how to use the prefers-reduced-motion media query](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/design-reduced-motion-sensitivities/) to take these users into account. The feature has fairly good support now across browsers (sorry IE users) and can be used in both CSS and JavaScript.

For example, being very specific about your services up-front can help avoid headaches down the line.
